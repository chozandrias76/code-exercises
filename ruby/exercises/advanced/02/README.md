### Challenge: **Matrix Spiral Copy**

Given a 2D array (matrix) `inputMatrix` of integers, create a function that returns an array containing all the elements of `inputMatrix` in spiral order. Spiral order starts at the top left corner of the matrix, goes to the right, and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element has been visited.

#### Example:
Input:
```rb
inputMatrix = [
  [1,  2,  3,  4],
  [12, 13, 14, 5],
  [11, 16, 15, 6],
  [10,  9,  8, 7]
]
```
Output:
```rb
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
```

#### Instructions:
1. Your function should take a 2D array as an argument.
2. Ensure your solution is efficient and handles matrices of different dimensions.
3. Provide your solution in Ruby. Use the Markdown code block syntax (```rb) for your submission.
