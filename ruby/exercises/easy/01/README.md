# Challenge: Array Element Parity
## Objective:
Write a Ruby function to find the element in an array that doesn't have a pair. The array will contain integers, and each integer will have exactly one pair except for one of them. Your function needs to identify and return this 'lonely' integer.

## Example:

* Input: [1, -1, 2, -2, 3]
* Output: 3
* Explanation: Every number except 3 has a negative counterpart in the array.

## Constraints:

* The array will have at least one element.
* The array can contain both positive and negative integers.

You can structure your Ruby code like this:

```rb
def find_lonely_integer(array)
  # Your code here
end
```
